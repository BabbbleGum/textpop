## **Best Template Recommendation**

I recommend starting with the **Supabase + Next.js Starter**, as it already includes all the tools in your tech stack (including shadcn/ui). This will save you time on setup and ensure compatibility across your chosen technologies. Additionally, it’s actively maintained by the Supabase team and has excellent documentation to guide you through the process.

If you prefer more flexibility or want to explore other options, the Create T3 App is a great alternative due to its modular design and community support.
